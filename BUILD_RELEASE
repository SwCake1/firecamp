To build a new release, a few steps are required. This will be enhanced in the future.

1. Update FireCamp software release version
1) Change the version in Makefile from "latest" to the release version such as "0.9".
2) Chagne the version in common/types.go from "latest" to the release version such as "0.9".
3) Update the "Release" to such as "0.9" and "QSCloudStaxS3KeyPrefix" to "firecamp/releases/0.9" in firecamp-master.template and firecamp-existingvpc.template


2. Upload the new files
Create the new release folder in the "cloudstax" bucket, such as firecamp/releases/0.9. Create subfolders: "templates", "scripts", and "packages". Upload all templates under packages/aws-cloudformation/ to "templates", upload packages/aws-cloudformation/init.sh to "scripts", and upload $GOPATH/bin/firecamp-service-cli.tgz and $GOPATH/bin/firecamp-swarminit.tgz to "packages". The swarminit command is used by packaging/aws-cloudformation/init.sh to initialize the Docker Swarm cluster.

Note: the default template allows '.' in the QSCloudStaxS3KeyPrefix. AWS QuickStart always points to the latest version, such as aws/vpc/latest for QSAWSVPCS3KeyPrefix. '.' is not allowed in the key prefix. For the new release, when updating the AWS QuickStart git, remove '.' in the QSCloudStaxS3KeyPrefix and point to the latest version in QuickStart.
Also change "QSS3BucketName" from "cloudstax" to "quickstart-reference".


3. Docker Images
make docker to build the docker images for this release, and upload to docker hub. If Amazon ECS agent git creates a new version, update cloudstax/amazon-ecs-agent, build a new container and push to docker hub.


4. The plugin log file rotates
If vendor is updated, check to make sure the glog log file size is adjusted.

glog rotates the log file at MaxSize, glog_file.go, which is 1024*1024*1800 by default. Change to 64MB. So we could keep 20 log files for troubleshooting.
