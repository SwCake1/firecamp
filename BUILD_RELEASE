To build a new release, 3 steps are required. This will be enhanced in the future.

1. Update the version information
Currently need to update multiple files.
1) The version in Makefile
2) Version in common/types.go
3) Update the "Release" and "CFS3KeyPrefix" in firecamp-master.template and firecamp-test.template

2. Docker Images
make docker to build the docker images for this release.

3. Create packages in cloudstax S3 bucket
1) Create the release "cf-templates" folder in the cloudstax S3 bucket, and upload all files in packaging/aws-cloudformation.
2) Create the release "packages" folder in the cloudstax S3 bucket,
- upload $GOPATH/bin/firecamp-service-cli.tgz
- upload $GOPATH/bin/firecamp-swarminit.tgz
- if the ECS init branch is updated, create an EC2 Amazon Linux on AWS, build the ECS init rpm at cloudstax/amazon-ecs-init and upload the rpm. If the branch has no change, simply upload the same rpm in the previous release.
