1. Update the version information
Currently need to update multiple files.
1) The version in Makefile
2) Version in common/types.go
3) Update the version information in cloudformation templates
- cloudstax/firecamp-manageserver image version in packaging/aws-cloudformation/firecamp-ecs.template
- Update the firecamp plugin version and ecs init rpm version in firecamp-autoscalegroup.template
- Update the cf-templates place to the release folder, CFS3KeyPrefix, in firecamp-master.template and firecamp-test.template

2. Docker Images
make docker to build the docker images for this release.

3. Create packages in cloudstax S3 bucket
- Create the release "cf-templates" folder in the cloudstax S3 bucket, and upload all template files in packaging/aws-cloudformation.
