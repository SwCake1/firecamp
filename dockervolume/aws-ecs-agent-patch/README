AWS ECS currently does not support to specify volume driver. Once AWS ECS supports
the custom volume driver, there is no need to patch ecs-agent.

Apply patch
1. copy openmanage_task_engine.go to cloudstax/amazon-ecs-agent/agent/engine/
2. apply docker_task_engine_patch to agent/engine/docker_task_engine.go
3. apply makefile_patch to Makefile

Then simply sudo make to build the ecs-agent container image.


To initialize cloudstax/amazon-ecs-agent on EC2 for the first time, run start_ecs_agent.sh.
If the system is reboot after ecs-agent initialized, run: docker start ecs-agent-containerID.
The work to automatically start ecs-agent during boot is in progress.
